This is the repository for a model of thermo-hyperelasticity using a Constitutive Neural Network (CANN) architecture build with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

The architecture is based on the publications of  [K. Linka et al. (2021): *Constitutive artificial neural networks: A fast and general approach to predictive data-driven constitutive modeling by deep learning*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2020.110010) and [K. Linka & E. Kuhl (2023): *A new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks towards automated model discovery*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2022.115731).

## Getting started
This model was developed under Python 3.8.10. The required packages for executing the example scripts can be found in the [requirements file](requirements.txt). To install them into a virtual environment please proceed as follows:
```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code
### Pretrained model
TBC

### Training the model
TBC

### Running unittests
To run the unit tests provided by this implementation, please use the following 
```bash
python -m unittest
```
from the root directory of this repository. Please be aware that there is not a 100% code coverage. Coverage reports can be generated using the coverage module as 
```
coverage run -m unittest
```

## Datasets
The repository contains various datasets. Datasets can be loaded using the functionality provided within the ```src/data.py``` package.

### Treloar data for hyperelasticity
The data from the famous paper of [Treloar (1944): *Stress-Strain data for vulcanised rubber under various types of deformation*](https://doi.org/10.1039/TF9444000059) is located in ```data/Treloar```. The original dataset is a copy of the version published in [P. Steinmann, M. Hossain, G. Possart (2012): *Hyperelastic models for rubber-like materials: consistent tangent operators and suitability for Treloarâ€™s data*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00419-012-0610-z).

The original data is availabel as both numpy arrays stored in ```.pkl``` files as well as in ```.csv``` format. To open the data 
from ```.pkl``` files use the ```load_treloar()``` function from ```src/data.py```. To load a fitted verison of the original data using the Arruda & Boyce model, please use 
```load_treloar(arruda_boyce_fit=True)```. This will give you more datapoints to train your model.


### Artificially generated data for thermo-hyperelasticity
