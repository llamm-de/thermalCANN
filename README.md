# Thermoelastic Constitutive Neural Network (tempCANN)

This is the repository for a model of thermo-hyperelasticity using a Constitutive Neural Network architecture build with TensorFlow.
The architecture is based on the publication of [K. Linka & E. Kuhl (2022): *A new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks towards automated model discovery*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2022.115731).

## Getting started
The required packages for executing the example scripts can be found in the [requirements file](requirements.txt). To install them, you can build a virtual environment as follows:
```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code examples
TBC
